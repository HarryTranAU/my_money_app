# Idea

The idea is a budget/money management app. The best way to describe my vision for the app is a lite version of YNAB or Mint. My app will support csv files imported from the big 4 Aussie banks (Commbank, NAB, Westpac, ANZ)

My app will allow users to:

 - create/login to a personal account
 - create a budget linked to the users account
 - add/remove transactions from a budget
 - import transactions from a csv file to a budget
 - view net worth (graph?)
 - view income/expense
 - filter transactions by date, amount, description
